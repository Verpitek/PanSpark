            This release includes changes based on the commit history since the last version.
            
            **Build Artifacts:**
            - panspark.js
            
          # Only attach the generated JS file to the release
          files: ./dist/panspark.js
          
          # This ensures that if the tag already exists, it will update the release
          # which is helpful if the action needs to be rerun.
